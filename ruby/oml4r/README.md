# OML4R

This is a simple client library for OML which does not use liboml2 and its
filters, but connects directly to the server using the text protocol.
User can use this library to create ruby applications which can send
measurement to the OML collection server. A simple example on how to use
this library is attached at the end of this file. Another example can be
found in the file oml4r-example.rb

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'oml4r'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install oml4r

## Usage

See examples files oml4r-simple-example.rb and oml4r-wlanconfig.rb.
