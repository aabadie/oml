    abstract = {Experimentation for research on the future Internet involves observing multiple
metrics at various distributed points of the network under observa- tion. Be it
in a testbed or in an uncontrolled field experiment, collecting these
measurements is not an easy task. The relevant experimental data tends to be
scattered across multiple hosts in different, incompatible formats, and
sometimes buried amongst a trove of other measurements, irrelevant to the
current question. Collecting, selecting and formatting the useful records is a
time-consuming manual operation. In this paper, we present a conceptual
framework to facilitate this task. It includes a common representation of any
type of experimental data, as well as the elements to process and collect the
measurement samples. We then introduce the OML suite, an instrumen- tation
library following the concept of this framework. We outline its API and how it
can be used to instrument an experiment in only a few lines of code. We also
present an evaluation of this library, demonstrating that it can be used
non-intrusively with respect to the processes and systems under observation, as
well as confirming the validity of the proposed framework.},

    abstract = {Networking researchers using testbeds containing mobile nodes face the problem of measurement collection from disconnected nodes. We solve this problem efficiently by adding a proxy server to the Orbit Measurement Library (OML) to transparently buffer measurements on disconnected nodes, and we give results showing our solution in action. We then add a flexible filtering and feedback mechanism on the server that enables a tailored hierarchy of measurement collection servers throughout the network, live context-based steering of experiment behaviour, and live context-based control of the measurement collection process itself. We finish by comparing our architecture to existing work.},

    abstract = {In this paper we present ORBIT measurement framework and library (OML), which is a distributed software framework enabling real-time collection of data in a large distributed environment. The success of a multiuser distributed testbed facility depends largely on the ease of use, remote access as well as on the ease of collecting useful measurements from experimental runs. OML provides a flexible and dynamic way in which data is collected and made available for realtime access to the experimenters. Application programmers can use simple interfaces provided to transfer measurements and other performance data to a central repository. This paper focuses on the motivation, requirements, design, implementation and real world usage of OML that is designed to provide a scalable, controllable and easy to use mechanism for experimenters to collect useful results from the experiments conducted on the ORBIT testbed.},
