.SH DESCRIPTION
.B
oml2-server
(OML2 Server) is the daemon program for OML.  It collects
measurements from client applications and stores them in a measurement
database.
.PP
.B
oml2-server
listens for connections from clients.  It is normally started at boot
as a system service.  Each client declares which experiment
it belongs to (using the
.I --oml-exp-id
option of the
.B liboml2
client library), and then sends a stream of measurement packets.  The
measurements for each client are stored in the experiment
database belonging to the client's experiment.
.PP
If the client declares that it belongs to experiment EXP, then
.B
oml2-server
will look for an existing experiment database named EXP.sq3 in the
data directory (see the
.I \-\-data-dir
option).  Currently
.B oml2-server
uses SQLite3 as the database backend, hence the .sq3
file name extension. If the database exists already,
.B oml2-server
will open it and append new measurements from the client to it.  If
EXP.sq3 does not exist,
.B oml2-server
will attempt to create the measurement database, initialize it for
use, and then append new measurements from the client to it.
Measurement streams from subsequent clients belonging to the same
experiment EXP will also be written to EXP.sq3.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-l, \-\-listen=port"
Listen for measurement client connections on the given
.IR port .
The default
.I port
is 3003.
.TP
.I "\-\-data-dir=directory"
Store measurement databases for all experiments in the specified
.IR directory .
The default directory is the current working directory.
.TP
.I "\-d, \-\-debug-level=level"
Set the verbosity of log output to
.IR level .
The
.I level
should be an integer from 1 to 4 (1=
.BR ERROR ,
2 =
.BR WARNING ,
3 =
.BR INFO ,
4 =
.BR DEBUG ")."
The default log verbosity is 3,
.BR INFO "."

.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.B oml2-server
does not use any authentication, and should thus be considered
insecure.  It is intended to be deployed behind firewalls on a
dedicated testbed network.  It should not be run as a daemon on an
open network.  Future versions of OML may be re-designed to be
suitable for use in insecure environments.
