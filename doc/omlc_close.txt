omlc_close(3)
=============

NAME
----
omlc_close - shutdown the OML client library

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*#include <oml2/omlc.h>*
[verse]
'int' *omlc_close*('void');

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*omlc_close*() shuts down the OML client library, and stops all
measurement processes.  It also flushes all measurement streams to try
to ensure that all measurements are stored correctly before the
application terminates.  The application should call *omlc_close*() if
it intends to exit.

If *omlc_inject*(3) is called after *omlc_close*(3) has been called,
then it will be ignored and not measurement collection will take
place.  Other API functions will return with an error.

RETURN VALUE
------------

*omlc_close*() returns 0 on success; on error it returns -1.

ERRORS
------

*omlc_close*() will succeed unless the API has not already been
initialized by a call to *omlc_init*(3).
