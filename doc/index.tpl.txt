DESCRIPTION
-----------

OML is an instrumentation tool that allows application writers to define
customizable measurement points inside new or per-existing applications.
Experimenters running the applications can then direct the measurement
streams (MS) from these measurement points (MP) to storage in a remote
measurement database.

The OML reporting chain consists in several elements:

* the reporting library (C, Ruby or Python),
* the collection server,
* the optionnal proxy, for disconnected experiments.
