	* OML: New version 2.3.3.

	* OML: Fix bugs:  #196, #223

	* liboml2: Fix a memory allocation bug in client filters; fix
	definitions of omlc_set_string() and omlc_set_const_string()
	macros.

	* oml2-server: Fix a bug that prevented clients from multiple
	different experiments from connecting to the server at the same
	time.  This caused the server to hang in an infinite loop.  Fix
	the server to close the socket when a client disconnects, to
	prevent lots of sockets stuck in CLOSE_WAIT on the server host
	machine.  Removed a meaningless log message from the server log
	output.

	* iperf_oml2: Change names of MP's to be more understandable; fix
	a portability issue.

	* OML: New version 2.3.1.

	* liboml2: Fix bug #177, segfault when attempting to marshall NULL
	strings.

	* OML: Release version 2.3.0.

	* OML: Package is now autoconfiscated.

	* OML: Package now builds under Mac OS X (but is not well tested
	on that platform).

	* OML: Layout of the source package has been re-organized to make
	it cleaner.

	* oml2-server: Added server capability to re-open existing
	experiment databases and add new measurements to them.  This
	allows long running experiments where the client applications may
	be restarted many times.

	This required the server to create two additional tables in the
	experiment database: '_experiment_data' and '_senders'.  The
	'_senders' table stores a mapping between the client's sender
	id (as specified in either the --oml-id command line option, the
	OML_NAME environment variable, or 'id' attribute of the XML
	configuration file on the client side) and the server-generated
	numeric id that is stored in the 'oml_sender_id' column of the
	measurement tables.  The '_experiment_metadata' table is a generic
	key-value table that can be used to store arbitrary experiment
	metadata.  Currently the OML server uses this to store the
	experiment's start-time, which is the time reference against which
	all of the client data timestamps are calculated.

	* oml2-server: New text-based protocol added.
	lib/client/ruby/oml.rb implements a client for this protocol.

	* oml2-server: Removed buffer overflow conditions in SQL prepared
	statement generation, and removed an unintended artificial limit
	on the size of table schema (both number of characters and number
	of columns).

	* oml2-server: Significant improvements in error condition
	handling on the server.  Clients are now dropped if the server
	detects a protocol error.

	* oml2-server: Server was given a thorough code review and
	numerous segfaults, memory leaks, and other bugs were fixed.  Ran
	the server under valgrind memcheck to find run-time memory errors,
	and fixed another bunch of numerous memory handling errors.

	* liboml2: XML configuration file format has been modified to be
	more expressive.  This change is incompatible with XML
	configuration files from previous versions of OML.  See
	app/simple/config.xml for an example of the new format.

	* liboml2: Added a prototype custom filter API.  This is not
	documented and will be modified in the next release.

	* liboml2: Client headers are now suitable for direct inclusion in
	C++ translation units; they automatically perform extern "C"
	guarding as appropriate.

	* liboml2: Client now detects server disconnects and handles them
	gracefully.  If a measurement stream that was connected to an OML
	server suffers a disconnect, the stream is shut down (or rather,
	its writer is) and the application continues, sending measurements
	to any remaining streams with active writers (whether to file or
	to another OML server).

	* liboml2: Added OML_SERVER environment variable as an alternative
	way to specify the server to which to send measurements.  This is
	overridden by an XML configuration file or the --oml-server
	command line option, if present.  The file:// protocol is
	understood by this environment variable.

	* liboml2: Added --oml-list-filters client command line option.

	* liboml2: Added new standard deviation filter (stddev).

	* oml2-server, liboml2: Server and client now both report the same
	version number (which is identical to the package version number).

	* oml2-server, liboml2: Server and client now both report the
	protocol version to their logging streams on startup.

	* oml2-server, liboml2: Fixed lots of compiler warnings.

	* apps: Integrated the OTG project source into the OML project
	tree.  The OTG source tree builds two applications, otg2 and otr2.

	* apps: All applications except for otg2, otr2, and the simple
	example application, now name their binaries according to the
	format '<app_name>_oml2', to signify that they are OML2 client
	applications.

	* apps: Added radiotap support to trace_oml2 (app/omf_trace).

	* apps: Added application iperf under app/iperf.
