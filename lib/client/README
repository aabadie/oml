Client-side OML library
=======================

This directory contains the source code for the OML client side library.

api.c

   This file contains the functions that implement the OML API. 

bin_writer.c

   An implementation of the OmlWriter interface functions (see
   oml2/oml_writer.h) that writes messages using the OML binary
   protocol.

buffered_writer.c

   Implements a non-blocking, self-draining FIFO queue using threads.

file_stream.c

   An OmlOutStream implementation that writer that writes measurement
   tuples to a file on the local filesystem.

filter.c

   Implementation of OML's client-side filter engine.

init.c

   Implemention of the OML API initialisation routines.

misc.c

   Contains miscellaneous locking functions used to synchronize the
   multi-threaded implementation.

net_stream.c

   An OmlOutStream implementation that writer that sends measurement
   tuples over the network.

parse_config.c

   The XML configuration file parser functions.

text_writer.c

   An implementation of the OmlWriter interface functions (see
   oml2/oml_writer.h) that serializes measurement tuples using the OML
   text protocol.
