OML Communications Library (ocomm)
==================================

This directory contains the source code for the ocomm library which
provides an abstraction layer for socket-based communications. The
code here contains both client and server functionality.

eventloop.c

   Callback-based event loop supporting file descriptors, sockets and
   timers.

log.c

   The implementation for the logerror(), logwarn(), loginfo() and
   logdebug() logging functions.


socket.c

   A thin abstraction layer that manages sockets and provides some
   additional state management functions.

socket_group.c

   Functions for managing a group of sockets as a unit. Internally
   maintains a linked list of sockets which can be modified at
   runtime.
