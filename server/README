   processes messages in either OML's text or binary formats.

database_adapter.h

   Generic functions that apply to both of the database adapters.

hook.c

   Implements the event hook so that an external program can be called
   by the OML server.

oml2-server.c

   The top-level main() and its supporting functions.

psql_adapter.c

   Adapter code for the PostgreSQL database backend.

sqlite_adapter.c
