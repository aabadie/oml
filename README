Autotools+Git-based ArchLinux packaging

Olivier Mehani <olivier.mehani@nicta.com.au>

The PKGBUILD.proto in this branch contains both statements to generate a point
release (oml2; from a tag or any arbitrary commit) or a git package (oml2-git).
It is unlikely that makepkg(8) will me happy with it as such.

Some additional markup, disguised as comments (#<GIT\n...\n#GIT> and
#<!GIT\n...\n#!GIT>), indicates specific sections.  The
autoconf/automake-generated Makefile makes sense of it be removing the
irrelevant sections to create the appropriate PKGBUILD.
